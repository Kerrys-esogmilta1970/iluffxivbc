Wow. Just stepped out of the theater and like, I’m not sure if I've just been to a wedding or an insane asylum. You're Cordially Invited is wild and, I mean, really wild. The   feels like a kaleidoscope had a baby with a whirlwind. Do those even mate? Anyway. I have never eaten so much popcorn, it got stuck everywhere, even the guy next to me wore some of it ahaha. Trying to piece this all together... like, have you ever had 3 dreams at once? That’s the  . But louder.

Twisting plotlines, they're like tangled Christmas lights that nobody bothers to untangle but everyone just sort of deals with it blinking all weird. There’s this one scene at the altar – who even writes these vows? It’s like someone on a sugar rush channeled Hemingway. But in a good way. Sort of.

Oh my god, and there was this loud explosion at one point, I think it was a cake, or maybe that was just my heart when the couple started arguing. Felt like emotional dodgeball with knives. And that soundtrack, gosh, think music from a parade where the marching band forgot how to march. Truly, I loved it but like, HUH?! I guess I sort of forgot Karen asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but I’d say definitely just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . But don’t. I mean, do. God my brain.

>Zebras, zebras, zebras. I'm just thinking, you know, that one uncle character. No zebra but his energy was all zebra. All stripes and prancing and chaos. The aisle was a runway and the reception a circus, complete with a juggler or am I imagining that? The way this   juggles, yeah that's it. Juggles sense until you just give up trying to catch anything.

Back is killing me, these theater seats always feel like they’re from a medieval torture chamber. Sudden realization: was the main character dreaming the whole thing? That might explain the garden gnomes but I could be hallucinating. My head is still trying to wake up. It's like a brain alarm clock is still ringing. Boom boom boom.

Oh hell, they were dressed as penguins at the end... WHY?! Not even mad, just marveling at the absurd beauty of it. If it rains at your wedding, hope it's like this  . Manic, unpredictable, yet somehow joyous. Memory like stepping into a carnival then trying to exit the hall of mirrors without tripping. Karen needs to just, see it, and maybe electrodes on the temples to relax.
